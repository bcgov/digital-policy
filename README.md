**Context**

BC's Digital Framework (currently an alpha version) drives a coordinated, intentional approach to support all public service employees as we transition into a [digital government](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/) that meets the internet-era needs and expectations of British Columbians. A key action outlined in the Digital Framework is to “create a new digital and data policy framework to guide the work of public servants.” A core product team within the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is taking an agile, principle-based approach to co-developing a new Digital Policy Framework. This policy framework covers all aspects of BC government information management (IM) and information technology (IT) management.

The OCIO’s Chief Digital Officer, Jaimie Boyd, and Chief Policy Officer, Joel Fairbairn, are co-sponsoring the Digital Policy Framework. ADM and Chief Records Officer Kerry Pridmore is our Product Champion. An executive-level Reference Group with representatives from across the BC Government is guiding this work, but input from a wide array of stakeholders and end users is critical to our success.

**Purpose**

- Enable optimized use of government information and IT resources and enhanced services to citizens through a forward-thinking, cohesive and user-focused IM IT policy framework. This will include a modern and effective Core Policy on IM IT.
- The DigitalT Policy Framework will also enable streamlined future development of other corporate policy instruments, and iteration in response to emerging needs and priorities.

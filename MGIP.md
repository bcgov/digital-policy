## **INTRODUCTION**

## **Purpose**

This policy sets out ministry obligations for managing government information, specifically as they relate to [Information Management Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/15027) (IMA) requirements.

## **Overview**

The Province of British Columbia is the steward of a significant amount of [government information](#government-information), including [data](#data) and [records](#record). This policy is meant to help ministries understand their [information management (IM)](#information-management-im) obligations and must be considered in conjunction with:

* applicable legislation, including but not limited to IMA and the [Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96165_00) (FOIPPA);
* the Core Policy and Procedures Manual, specifically Chapter 12: Information Management and Information Technology Management;
* [directives and guidelines issued by the Chief Records Officer](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/central-government-agencies/corporate-information-records-management-office/information-management-act/cro-directives-guidelines) (CRO) under the IMA; and
* corporate policies, standards and strategic direction issued by government, including the [Standards of Conduct for BC Public Service Employees](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/about-the-bc-public-service/ethics-standards-of-conduct/standards-of-conduct), the [Draft Principles that Guide the Province’s Relationship with Indigenous Peoples](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/careers/about-the-bc-public-service/diversity-inclusion-respect/draft_principles.pdf), the Province’s Digital Principles, and IM IT policies and standards issued by Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).

The OCIO, which is led by the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO) and includes the CRO, is the central authority responsible for government IM IT. Both the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO) and the CRO collaborate with ministries to set corporate policy, standards and guidelines related to IM. The OCIO’s Government Records Service (GRS) provides expert advice and services to help ministries meet their IM obligations. Ministries are responsible for managing information in their custody or control in the way that makes the most sense for their lines of business. 

The Province of British Columbia is committed to diversity and inclusion, reconciliation and equity. To support a government where the needs of all people are reflected, ministries should consider opportunities to address these commitments throughout the information lifecycle. 

## **Application**

This policy applies to all ministries subject to the Core Policy and Procedures Manual. 

## **Authority**

Core Policy and Procedures Manual Chapter 12.

## **POLICY REQUIREMENTS**

Government information is a strategic enterprise asset that must be managed in accordance with its value. Efficient and effective IM:

* supports the design, development, implementation and evaluation of government policies, standards, processes, procedures, programs and services;
* fosters informed decision making;
* facilitates accountability, confidentiality, transparency and collaboration, and allows government to be more responsive to British Columbians;
* maintains information about, including evidence of, business activities and transactions;
* ensures information is preserved as long as it is required and appropriately transferred to the [government archives](#government-archives) if it is determined to have permanent value; and 
* ensures accessibility, discoverability and usability of information over time.

## **1. Creation and Use**

Ministries should apply the principles, standards and practices of the [records management](#records-management) discipline to managing government information in their custody or control. This includes information ministries create or receive. Taking a [lifecycle](#lifecycle) approach to understanding and managing government information will help ministries meet their IM obligations.

**Managing and Protecting Information**

1.1	Ministries must be aware of, and able to account for, the information in their custody or control. This includes identifying, documenting and managing government information in accordance with applicable legislation, policies, standards and procedures.

1.2	Ministries must protect the [integrity](#integrity), [authenticity](#authenticity) and [reliability](#reliability) of government information in their custody or control.

1.3	Ministries must ensure that information is identified adequately in order to be managed throughout its lifecycle. This involves using appropriate and consistent descriptive metadata, including names and naming conventions, and applying information schedules. 

1.4	In cases where government information is duplicated between ministries, or is created collaboratively, an office of primary responsibility (OPR) must be clearly identified. The OPR must manage the information, including substantive drafts, according to the appropriate information schedule.

**Access**

1.5	Ministries must make information in their custody or control [accessible](#accessibility) and discoverable. To this end, records must be legible/readable, available, and searchable.  

1.6	Ministries must be able to locate information in their custody or control in a timely manner.

1.7	Ministries must strive to ensure that accessibility standards are met throughout the information lifecycle. For more information, see the [Accessibility & Inclusion Toolkit](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/home/accessible-government/toolkit). 

**Critical Information**

1.8	Ministries must identify [critical information](#critical_information) in their custody or control. 

1.9	Ministries must ensure that critical information in their custody or control is protected in a manner that will allow the information to retain its integrity and remain reliable, usable, accessible, and secure for as long as needed. 

**Appropriate Systems**

[Section 19 (1) of the IMA](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/15027#section19) requires ministries to have an appropriate system in place for managing and securing government information. There are also various corporate policies and [standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/im-it-standards/find-a-standard) that contain requirements associated with managing and securing government information in an appropriate system, including but not limited to the following:

* [Information Security Policy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/information-security-policy-and-guidelines)
* [Privacy Management and Accountability Policy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/privacy-policy)
* Digitizing Government Information Standard

The IMA also requires that ministries have an appropriate system in place for creating and maintaining government information that is an adequate record of their decisions. The [CRO Directive on Documenting Government Decisions](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/organizational-structure/crown-corporations/central-agencies/cirmo-spl/cro_01-2019.pdf) sets out the components of an appropriate system for creating and maintaining government information that is an adequate record of decisions. 

The policy requirements below are meant to help ministries meet their IMA obligations as per section 19 (1) of the IMA.

1.10	When establishing a system for managing records throughout their lifecycle, ministries must ensure they meet the requirements of an appropriate system.

1.11	Ministries must ensure that government information and data are stored in systems and facilities that are monitored and maintained with appropriate security, access and environmental controls.

1.12	Ministries must design and implement IM and IT systems with due consideration for information retention, destruction, privacy and access requirements.  

1.13	Each ministry must maintain an inventory of all the systems it uses to manage information in its custody or control.

1.14	Ministries must perform a risk assessment for each of its IM systems to identify and measure:

      a.	the range of risks;
      
      b.	vulnerability to threats;
      
      c.	ministry roles and functions in crises; and 
      
      d.	potential business impacts in the event of system issues.

## **2. Classification, Scheduling and Appraisal**

As outlined in [section 2 (3)(b) of the IMA](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/15027#section2), the mandate of the CRO includes approving [information schedules](#information-schedule). This ensures that government records: 

* are linked to their business context through classifications;
* are retained as required according to authorized timetables; and
* are transferred to the government archives, disposed of according to authorized timetables, or approved for removal to a non-government organization. 

Within the Government of British Columbia, records classification is combined with information scheduling in one integrated system known as Administrative Records Classification System (ARCS) and Operational Records Classification Systems (ORCS).

Government information to which an information schedule applies must be held, transferred (e.g., from a ministry to an external body), archived (i.e. transferred to the government archives) or destroyed (disposed of in accordance with the information schedule, as specified in (section 10 of the IMA](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/15027#section10)). In addition:

   2.1	Ministries must follow processes set out by the CRO for the development, approval, and implementation of information schedules. For guidance, see [RIM 201 Records Schedule Development, Approval and Amendment](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/services-policies-for-government/policies-procedures/recorded-information-policy/rim201_18.pdf).  

## **3. Preservation and Storage**

**Preservation**

Government must preserve information to ensure the integrity of the evidence of its business, meet its legal obligations, and demonstrate accountability. 

3.1	Ministries must ensure government information in their custody or control is preserved in a manner that protects authenticity, accessibility and context (understandability) throughout the information’s existence. This pertains to information in all formats (e.g., digital and physical records).

3.2	Ministries must maintain records and data in formats that are stable and accessible in the long-term (i.e. as long as needed in accordance with the relevant information schedule). This includes reformatting and moving it to new systems when appropriate. 

3.3	When digitizing government information, ministries must follow the Digitizing Government Information Standard.

3.4	Ministries must ensure that any data migrations follow corporate policies, standards and procedures, and are managed and documented appropriately. 

3.5	Ministries must ensure that digital information is preserved for as long as the applicable information schedule requires.

**Storage**

3.6	Ministries transferring physical records to offsite storage must use approved records storage facilities and services. For guidance, see RIM 422 Preparing Records for Offsite Storage, Section 2.1: Using Approved Records Storage Facilities. 

3.7	Ministries must prepare records for storage in a manner that ensures the records will remain accessible for as long as they are required to support government business and accountability needs.

3.8	Ministries must apply appropriate metadata to information in accordance with the Metadata Standard and other relevant requirements. Metadata must be persistently linked with information, regardless of where the information is stored over time.

## **ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES**

## **DEFINITIONS**

### **Accessibility:**

The characteristic of being easily reached, retrieved, or used with minimum barriers. In the context of IM, accessibility refers to the availability and usability of recorded information. For information on the Province’s commitments to building a better B.C. for people with disabilities, please visit https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/accessibility.

### **Accession:**

A body of records registered as a unit (and given an accession number) for the purposes of administrative control. This includes physical identification and control of transfer, storage, retrieval, and disposition.  Accessions typically cover records maintained in a records storage facility contracted by government. 

### **Alienation:**

The permanent transfer of records and all present and future rights to the records from ministries to another entity in accordance with the IMA.

### **Authenticity:**

The quality of being genuine, not a counterfeit, and free from tampering or corruption. Authenticity alone does not automatically imply that the content of information is reliable or accurate; it merely establishes that information is what it purports to be and has verifiably been created by the person who claims to be the creator.

### **Classification:**

The process of identifying records or information in accordance with a predetermined filing or security system. This includes determination of the function and/or subject of a record and selection of the appropriate classification for filing.

### **Critical information:**

The records and data essential to the operations of a government business area. This includes information that supports business continuity by documenting and supporting core programs, functions, responsibilities and commitments (e.g., security and risk mitigation information, records needed to meet financial and legal requirements). Critical information also includes information of public interest and permanent value.

### **Data:**

The smallest meaningful units of recorded information generated by an organization, which gain significance when stored in a structured manner that enables them to be synthesized and interpreted.

### **Digital archives:**

As defined in [Part 1 of the IMA](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/15027#section1).

### **Dispose/Disposition:**

The process which enables government to dispose of records which no longer have operational value, either by permitting their destruction, by requiring their transfer to the government archives, or by agreeing to their alienation from control of government. 

### **Employee:**

An individual working for, or on behalf of, a ministry, agency, board or commission subject to the Core Policy and Procedures Manual. 

### **Government archives:**

The entirety of government information assets that have been appraised as having permanent value to government and society and are preserved and made publicly accessible. Government’s physical archival records are held by the Royal British Columbia Museum. The CRO is responsible for government’s digital archival holdings.  

### **Government information:**

As defined in Part 1 of the IMA. Can include both data and records.

### **Information:**

Any collection of data that is processed, analyzed, interpreted, classified or communicated in order to serve a useful purpose, present fact or represent knowledge in any medium or form.

### **Information management (IM):**

The means by which an organization plans, collects, organizes, governs, secures, uses, controls, disseminates, exchanges, maintains and disposes of its information; as well as any means through which the organization ensures that the value of that information is identified and used to its fullest extent, including the facilitation of efficient discoverability of information.

### **Information schedule:**

Approved by the CRO under the IMA, an information schedule provides a timetable that governs the lifecycle of government information. Information schedules specify how records are managed to ensure that government information is kept for as long as required and authorize the holding, transfer and disposal of records.

### **Integrity:**

The quality of being whole and unaltered through loss, tampering, or corruption. In the context of records, integrity relates to the potential loss of physical or intellectual elements after a record has been created. As one of the components used to determine a record’s authenticity, integrity is a relative concept that assesses whether the essential nature of a record has changed.

### **Lifecycle:**

The life span of information from its creation or receipt and use, through to its final disposition: destruction, archiving or alienation. 

### **Office of primary responsibility (OPR):**

### **Preservation:**

The principles, policies, rules, strategies, and activities aimed at prolonging the existence of an object by maintaining it in a condition suitable for use, either in its original format or in a more persistent format, while leaving intact the object's intellectual form.

### **Record:**

Information created, received and maintained by an organization or person, in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business. This includes records formats defined in the Interpretation Act and FOIPPA.

### **Records management:**

The field of management responsible for the efficient and systematic control of the creation, receipt, maintenance, use and disposition of records, including processes for capturing and maintaining evidence of and information about business activities and transactions in the form of records. (Source: ISO 15489, cited in International Council on Archives).

### **Reliability:**

In the context of the records management discipline, relates to the trustworthiness of a record as a statement of fact; a record’s ability to serve as reliable evidence. Reliability is established by examining the completeness of the record's form and the amount of control exercised on the process of its creation.

### **Service provider:**

A person retained under a contract or service agreement to perform services for a ministry, agency, board or commission subject to the Core Policy and Procedures Manual.

### **Supervisor:**

A person to whom an employee directly reports or a person who manages a service provider contract or service agreement.

## **INTRODUCTION**

## **Purpose**
	
This policy is meant to help government [employees](#employee) perform their duties in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, other corporate policies, and corporate standards and procedures related to information management (IM) and information technology (IT). This policy sets out the requirements that all employees must follow when:

* accessing and managing [government information](#government-information) (particularly [confidential information](#confidential-information)); and
* using government [IT resources](#IT-resources).

This policy also sets out specific IM IT requirements for supervisors.

## **Overview**

All government employees manage information and use government IT resources in the course of their daily work. As such, every employee is responsible for protecting government information, confidential information (including [personal information](#personal-information)) and government IT resources.

The Province of British Columbia expects employees to follow the [Standards of Conduct for Public Service Employees](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/about-the-bc-public-service/ethics-standards-of-conduct/standards-of-conduct), use sound and prudent judgement, and act in an ethical  manner in alignment with [BC Public Service Corporate Values](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/managers-supervisors/employee-labour-relations/conditions-agreements/accountability-framework/corporate-values) when:

* creating, collecting, accessing, using, disclosing or disposing of government information; 
* using IT resources, whether or not that use is directly related to their employment duties; and
* using social media—for more information, please see the [Social Media Guidelines for Personal Use](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/about-the-bc-public-service/ethics-standards-of-conduct/social-media-guidelines).

Employees and supervisors should be aware that this policy is part of a wider landscape of IM IT requirements. For example:

* the [Information Management Act (IMA)](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/15027) is the Province’s legislative framework for modern, digital IM practices;
* the collection, access, use, and disclosure of personal information must be in accordance with the [Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPPA)](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96165_00);
* [Core Policy and Procedures Manual (CPPM) Chapter 12: Information Management and Information Technology Management](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/policies-for-government/core-policy/policies/im-it-management)
   * sets out clear authority for IM IT policy at the corporate and ministry levels,
   * outlines high-level roles and responsibilities for government IM IT, and
   * provides the authority for the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO) to set corporate IM IT policies, standards, processes, procedures and guidelines; 
* the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) includes the Chief Records Officer, (CRO), who has the authority under the IMA to issue directives and guidelines related to IM; and 
* ministries may expect their employees to follow ministry-specific IM IT policies and procedures.

The Province is committed to reconciliation, equity and developing an efficient public service that is representative of the diversity of the people of British Columbia . To support a government where the needs of all people are reflected, every employee should consider opportunities to address these commitments when making decisions about using government information and IT resources. 

## **Application**

This policy applies to employees of all ministries, agencies, boards and commissions that are subject to CPPM. 

## **Authority**

CPPM Chapter 12.

## **POLICY REQUIREMENTS**

## **1.	Government Information**

Government information is a strategic enterprise asset that needs to be managed in accordance with its value. Employees must manage the information they create, store and dispose of in the course of their work in accordance with applicable legislation, policies and standards, including the policy requirements listed below. For additional information on ministry IM responsibilities, please see the Managing Government Information Policy.

***General***

_Employees_

1.1.	Employees must use government-provided accounts (e.g., email) when conducting government business.

1.2.	Employees must use a secure portal when accessing information on the government network, e.g., Virtual Private Network (VPN), email via Summer, BCNGN WiFi.

1.3.	Employees must store and save government information (e.g., documents, emails, etc.) in an appropriate system on a government network, e.g., LAN, EDRMS, line-of-business applications (SharePoint, case management systems).

1.4.	In extenuating circumstances, an employee may temporarily store government information outside of a government network or use a non-government communication account (e.g., a personal email account) to conduct government business. When such a situation occurs, the employee must, as soon as reasonably possible, transfer the government information to a government network and delete the information from the account/system in which the information was temporarily stored. 

1.5.	Employees must regularly dispose of transitory information that they create, collect, or receive, when it is no longer of value.

1.6.	In response to an active Freedom of Information (FOI) request or request for legal discovery, employees must not:
   a. willfully alter, falsify, conceal or dispose of government information (including transitory information); or 
   b. direct another person to do so, with the intent to evade a request for access to records.

1.7.	Employees must respect intellectual property rights. For example, employees must not use, reproduce, modify or distribute software or data without the intellectual property owner’s permission. 

_Supervisors_

1.8.	At the commencement of an employee’s employment, supervisors must ensure the employee is made aware of the corporate and ministry policies, standards, processes and procedures that they must follow when accessing and managing information. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, this policy and the Information Incident Management Policy.

1.9.	Supervisors must ensure that employees are made aware when a significant change occurs respecting their access to government information or IT resources, including but not limited to:
   a.	the issuance of a new government device;
   b.	access to a new information database;
   c.	an approved change in their workplace (see Flexible Workplaces & Information Security), and 
   d.	when a new or updated version of this policy or other IM IT policy or standard directly relevant to their work is issued.

1.10.	Supervisors must ensure that employees receive information management training appropriate to their position

1.11.	Supervisors must ensure that employees have the appropriate level of access to information, including confidential information, that is required to perform their duties.

***Confidential Information***

The Province is the steward of a significant amount of confidential information, including the personal information of British Columbians. All government employees need to do their part to protect confidential information. If an information incident occurs, employees and supervisors must follow the Information Incident Management Policy, which requires the immediate reporting of any suspected or actual information incident (including a privacy breach or cyber attack/phishing). In addition:

1.12.	Employees must actively protect confidential information, especially when working in public places (e.g., on a bus, in an airport). This includes ensuring that information is not viewable or accessible by unauthorized persons.

1.13.	Employees must secure confidential information in the workplace. This may include storing confidential paper records in locked drawers or cabinets; using strong passwords; and safeguarding devices used to store or access confidential information (e.g., lock your device when you’re not using it, ensure you sign out of a multi-function device after using it and that you don’t leave any confidential information on it).

1.14.	If confidential information is to be mailed or couriered, employees must use a trackable process, such as BC Mail or external couriers. Decryption passwords or paper-based information must not accompany the encrypted storage device that is mailed or couriered.

1.15.	Employees must limit the amount of confidential information, particularly personal information (which is subject to legal restrictions), that is disclosed, including through email or other communications such as instant messages, letters, faxes, etc.

1.16.	Employees must dispose of confidential information using methods that are secure and protect confidentiality. For example, confidential paper records must be disposed of in locked shredding bins. 

1.17.	Supervisors must review employees’ access to confidential information on a yearly basis to ensure the access remains necessary and appropriate.

## **2.	Government IT Resources**

2.1	Employees must securely manage and protect any government IT resources in their use. For specific information on mobile device management, please refer to the Mobile Device Guidelines.
